## Tic-Tac-Toe-game

## Description
* In this I have followed the official React tutorial to build an interactive tic-tac-toe game. Two players can play the game,
    Whoever  manage to get first a row or column full of "X"/"O" will win the game. We can also click on a button in the move
    list to go “back in time” and see what the board looked like just after that move was made.
    
## Technology Used
* React
